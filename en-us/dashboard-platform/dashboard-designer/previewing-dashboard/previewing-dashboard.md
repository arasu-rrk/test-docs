  This preview button will be visible across all the window tab views in Syncfusion Dashboard Designer, thereby allowing you to preview the dashboard from anywhere within application.

   You can preview and interact the dashboard only if dashboard service is running in web development server in parallel. This service get started as discussed [here](/en-us/dashboard-platform/dashboard-designer/installation#hosting-dashboard-service-in-iis-express).
   
   Dashboard Viewer can be split into two sections: `Title` and `Content`, like below.
