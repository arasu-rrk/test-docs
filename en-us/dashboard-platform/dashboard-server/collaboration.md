# Collaboration

This section explains on how to collaborate with other users in the Syncfusion Dashboard Server by commenting on Dashboards and Widgets.

Collaboration feature in Dashboard Server lets the users write comments on a Dashboard or a Widget to share with other users who has access to the Dashboard or the Widget. They are useful for tracking events and providing insights into those events. Users can also add links to other Dashboards or Widgets or any other external websites. 

Anyone with access to a Dashboard can write comments. When a comment has been added to a Dashboard, users who have notifications enabled in their profile, will be notified through email and system notifications. Learn more about Notifications in [this](/en-us/dashboard-platform/dashboard-server/notifications) section.
