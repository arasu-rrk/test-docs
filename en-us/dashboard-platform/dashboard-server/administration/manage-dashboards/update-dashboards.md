## Update Dashboards

This section explains on how to add Dashboards in the Syncfusion Dashboard Server.

### Steps to update a Dashboard

Dashboards can be updated to move the Dashboard to a different category. Name, description and the Dashboard file(`.sydx`) can be changed for the Dashboard in the update Dashboard dialog box.

1. Click on the `Update` option in the context menu of the Dashboard to be updated to open the update Dashboard dialog box.

2. Click on the `Update` button in the `Update Dashboard` dialog box after making changes to the Category, Name, Description or to the Dashboard file(`.sydx`). Comments can also be added if there is a change in the Dashboard file(`.sydx`) to maintain as `Version Comments`.
