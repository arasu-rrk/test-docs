# Localization

Localization is the process of adapting a website into different linguistic and cultural contexts - involving much more than the simple translation of text.

Syncfusion Dashboard Server is released with localization support.

The default language is English “en-US”.

Read the below documentation on how to add new localizations and how to edit existing localizations in the Syncfusion Dashboard Server.
